# DevOps Homelab

My first try to creating a DevOps Homelab enviroment 

Later evolved to a Kubernetes Homeserver and Turning my Machine into a `KVM` Hypervisor using `Terraform
`

### Tools used 

- Ansible to configure Ubuntu Machines and harden them
- Vagrant to provision Machines
- Docker to create containerized services
- Kubernetes to orchestrate said services
- Python and  Bash for  some sumple automation Scripts
